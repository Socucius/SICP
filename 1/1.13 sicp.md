Actually, this exercise isn't about programming, but about mathematics and it's power.  

First of all, we should prove that `Fib(n) = (phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5)`.  
Let's use mathematical induction.  

###### Step 1

`Fib(1) = 1 = (phi^1 - psi^1)/sqrt(5) = (1 + sqrt(5) - 1 + sqrt(5))/2sqrt(5) = 2sqrt(5)/2sqrt(5) = 1`.
So, 1 == 1. It's true.

###### Step 2

`Fib(n+1) = (phi^(n+1) - psi^(n+1))/sqrt(5)`  
`Fib(n+1) = Fib(n) + Fib(n-1) =     
(phi^(n) - psi^(n))/sqrt(5) + (phi^(n-1) - psi^(n-1))/sqrt(5) =  
(phi^(n-1)(phi+1) - psi^(n-1)(psi+1))/sqrt(5)`  

One important thing to mention is that `phi^2 = phi + 1`. And so about the psi. So, with the help of this knowledge we can perform transformation.

`(phi^(n-1)(phi^2) - psi^(n-1)(psi^2))/sqrt(5) =  
(phi^(n+1) - psi^(n+1))/sqrt(5)`. That's true!

In the second part of the exercise we must prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to phi^n/sqrt(5).
What means the closest integer? It means that `phi^n/sqrt(5) - (phi^(n) - psi^(n))/sqrt(5)` is less than `1/2`.
If we transform this expression we come to the fact that we need to prove that `psi^n/sqrt(5)` is less than `1/2`.
We know that psi is `(1-sqrt(5))/2`.
So, for example, for n = 1 we get `|1-sqrt(5)/2sqrt(5)| < sqrt(5)/2sqrt(5) --> |1-sqrt(5)| < sqrt(5)`. It's true.
But it's common knowledge that `psi^n/sqrt(5)` will always be <= `1/2`. Just because the psi equals to `0.618`.
